HR Workforce Insight Dashboard-

*Project Overview-

  This HR Workforce Insight Dashboard analyzes employee attendance data to provide valuable insights into working preferences (WFH vs. WFO), leave trends, and sick leave patterns. The dataset contains employee attendance records for April, May, and June 2022, spanning over 1,000 rows. This project aims to help HR teams understand employee behavior, attendance, and the reasons behind leave trends, specifically focusing on sick leave insights.

*Problem Statement-

  ..Working Preferences: Understanding the balance between Work from Home (WFH) and Work from Office (WFO) preferences among employees.
  
  ..Leave Analysis: Identifying common reasons behind employee leaves and understanding trends in leave usage.
  
  ..Sick Leave Insights: Calculating the percentage of sick leave taken across the workforce.

*Data Processing and Analysis-

1.Data Loading and Cleaning:

  ..Combined multiple Excel sheets into a unified dataset for easy management and analysis using Power Query.
  
  ..Converted the first row of data into headers for better readability.
  
  ..Developed a dynamic function to handle data efficiently across different sheets, ensuring flexibility for future updates.
  
  ..Used Power Query for advanced data transformation and cleaning tasks like handling null values and merging tables.
  
2.Data Calculations:

  ..Total Working Days: Calculated the total number of working days for each employee.
  
  ..Presence Percentage: Determined each employee's presence percentage based on their attendance data.
  
  ..Total Present Days: Counted the total number of days employees were present (either WFH or WFO).
  
  ..Leave Reason Analysis: Identified the common reasons for leave (e.g., sick leave, personal leave).
  
  ..Sick Leave Insights: Calculated the percentage of sick leave taken in relation to total working days.

*Dashboard Development and Visualizations-

  ..Power BI was used to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard with key insights.
